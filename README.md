This project contains our implementation of the RISK board game with a Reinforcement Learning framework.
The game is coded in the utils folder, and some Jupyter notebooks help playing with the code.
Some images are stored in the images folder, a gif of a game played with the code is in the gifs folder.
Some agents trained on the game are stored in the models folder (see the agent_evaluation.ipynb notebook).
